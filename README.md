### 1.Title of the project
Covid-19 interactive & intuitive visualization & forecasting
### 2.Which is the problem the solution solves? (max. 200 words)
For many of us, the current development of Covid-19 resembles a big black-boxwhich we cannot access intuitively. Reliable information is scarce, especially regarding smaller countries with a lower media coverage. Furthermore, in a more and more globalized and connected world, people are also interested into being able to oversee the Covid-19 development for different countries of the world without having to access local media. Social media could be one of those possibilities, but information there often lacks reliability. The websites of governments or (inter-)national organizations could be another option, but manyof those sources lack interactivity, forecasts or seem overloaded with different kinds of information. Therefore, people are often not able to interpret their homecountry’s exposure to Covid-19 correctly and may not understand why their country has chosen certain measures to limit the spread of the disease. This might lead to public criticism and rejection against current strategies which could – in the end – worsen Covid-19 development worldwide.
